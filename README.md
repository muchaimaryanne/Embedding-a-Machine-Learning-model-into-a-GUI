# Embedding-a-Machine-Learning-model-into-a-GUI
This project involves creating a UI for both a regression and classification problem on both streamlit and gradio. 

# Customer Churn Prediction App using Gradio
This is a simple web application built with Python and Gradio that predicts whether a customer will churn or not based on user inputs such as tenure, monthly charges, and total charges among others. It uses a trained machine learning model built with scikit-learn to make the predictions.

# Sales Prediction App using Gradio
This is a simple web application built with Python and Streamlit that predicts the sales of products from a particular chain store.

# Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app with python app.py
4. Access the app by visiting http://localhost:7860

# Usage
1. Once the app is running, enter the necessary input features in the provided input fields to see the prediction results.
2. Streamlit App for Product Sales Prediction
3. This is a Streamlit app that predicts the sales of products in a chain store. It   is built with Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn. The app uses a trained regression model to make the predictions.

# Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app with streamlit run app.py
4. Access the app by visiting http://localhost:8501
5. Create your virtual environment using python -m venv env command in terminal.
6. Activate your environment using  .\env\Scripts\activate command in terminal.
7. Install the different app requirements using : 
* pip install requirements -r streamlit_requirements.txt and/or 
* pip install requirements -r gradio_requirements.txt

# Usage
Once the app is running, select the necessary input features from the provided dropdowns and input fields to see the prediction results.
